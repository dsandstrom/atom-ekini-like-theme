# Ekini Like - An Atom Syntax Theme


###### Originally based on [Ekini Edit](http://blog.ekini.net/2009/11/19/ekini-edit-a-gedit-scheme-that-is-dark-and-suitable-for-low-light-conditions/), a gedit theme created by Wenbert Del Rosario.

Wenbert describes it as:

I say it looks like a candy necklace.

It is green heavy (which is my favorite color), with yellow, white, blue, and pink highlights.
I think it looks best with [Ekini Like UI Theme](https://atom.io/themes/ekini-like-ui).

### Note
I created a [Sublime Text/TextMate theme](https://github.com/dsandstrom/EkiniScheme)
and used `apm` to convert to an Atom theme.  There is also a [vim conversion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3159).
The font is *Inconsolata*.

### Todo
It's a simple conversion, so I need to spend some time on it.

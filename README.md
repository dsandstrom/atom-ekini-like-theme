# Ekini Like - An Atom Syntax Theme


###### Originally based on [Ekini Edit](http://blog.ekini.net/2009/11/19/ekini-edit-a-gedit-scheme-that-is-dark-and-suitable-for-low-light-conditions/), a gedit theme created by Wenbert Del Rosario.

Wenbert describes it as:
> A dark scheme with reduced glare and improved readability...,
> it is based on the Zendburn and Thankful Eyes.

It is green heavy (which is my favorite color), with yellow, white, and pink highlights.
I think it looks like a candy necklace.

I created a [Sublime Text/TextMate theme](https://github.com/dsandstrom/EkiniScheme)
and used `apm` to convert to an Atom theme.  There is also a [vim conversion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3159).
